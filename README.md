1. A 3D contact map is created from .pdb atomic coordinates using alignment of two proteins (matrix distance cutoff=8A) using projection matrices
2. Combined contact map is converted to a 3D crystal structure from which dihedral angles terminal domain residues are calculated
3. Fluorescence of combined protein is determined as quantum yield
4. Matrix Shannon entropy of 3D structure is calculated from eigenvalues of the density matrix to determine information transfer in multimer structure
5. Kinetic Monte Carlo Model of exciton diffusion: continuously perturbed fractal grid diffuses excitons based on hopping probabilities
6. Tangle/entropy values are determined from KMC density matrix over simulation
